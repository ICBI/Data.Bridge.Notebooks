# Summary of the Georgetown-SDOH Database

## What is it ?
As part of the AIM AHEAD Data bridge initiative, the Georgetown-ICBI Team has downloaded, formatted and stored many of these datasets in the Googleâ€™s cloud based datawarehouse system BigQuery.

## Data sources used to populate the Georgetown-SDOH Database with a short description

====> Some of the short descriptions need to be better summarized

## Methodology
Detailed metadata about each data source was first noted such as, information about the number of records, date of last upate, type of access and data formats. 
A summary of the attributes (i.e. variables) and its data type was also made. Depending on the information desired, multiple datasources were merged based on a common attribute such as the "Geographic Entity ID" or GEOID

Detialed summaries of how each data source are provided in this mult-tab excel sheet: ====> ADD FILE HERE 

## How to access the Georgetown-SDOH database
The information summarized in the Georgetown-SDOH database is accessible through multiple ways
(a) Access using python scripts that can directly query the Georgetown-SDOH Bigquery database (easiest and most popular, hence highly recommended)
(b) Directly querying the Georgetown-SDOH Bigquery database using SQL-like commands (read-only access offered on a case-by-case basis to a limited audience with experience in programming)
(c) Access using R script (future)
(d) Access using BigQuery APIs (future)

Detailed tutorials are provided for each option
