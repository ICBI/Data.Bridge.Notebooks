# Summary of the Georgetown-SDOH Datawarehouse

## What is it ?
As part of the AIM AHEAD Data bridge initiative, the Georgetown-ICBI Team has downloaded, formatted and stored many of these datasets in the Googleâ€™s cloud based datawarehouse system BigQuery.

## Data sources used to populate the Georgetown-SDOH Datawarehouse with a short description

## Methodology
Detailed metadata about each data source was first noted such as, information about the number of records, date of last upate, type of access and data formats. 
A summary of the attributes (i.e. variables) and its data type was also made. Depending on the information desired, multiple datasources were merged based on a common attribute such as the "Geographic Entity ID" or GEOID

Detialed summaries of how each data source are provided in this mult-tab excel sheet [HERE](https://github.com/ICBI/Data.Bridge.Notebooks/blob/main/ICBI%20Social%20Determinants%20Public%20Data%20Sources.xlsx)

## How to access the Georgetown-SDOH datawarehouse
The information summarized in the Georgetown-SDOH database is accessible through multiple ways. Detailed tutorials are provided for each option
* Access using python scripts that can directly query the Georgetown-SDOH Bigquery datawarehouse 
(_easiest and most popular, hence highly recommended)_
* Access using R script 
* Directly querying the Georgetown-SDOH Bigquery datawarehouse using SQL-like commands 
_(read-only access offered on a case-by-case basis to a limited audience with experience in programming)_
* Access using BigQuery APIs _(future)_
