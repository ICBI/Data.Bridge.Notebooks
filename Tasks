# Data Bridge Notebooks

## About
* Webpage - https://www.aim-ahead.net/data-and-research-core/aadbaccess/
* GUMC language was added. Need to make a page for us.

## Task 1
Provide synthetic versions of some data sets starting with
https://www.aim-ahead.net/data-and-research-core/aadbaccess/cardiometabolic-correlates-
and-maternal-health-data/

* Synthetic data - still waiting on approval from MedStar to get a copy of the data for us to work on. This Maternal data set has been used to develop a commercial
ML tool to predict heart disease. That tool is proprietary but we can look into seeing if we can develop a method and see if it works on syn data. Or ask the company to test their tool on the synth data

* When available will make Synthetic set available to AA for training etc.
How? TBD either via a GU website or MedStar. Would be good to see what we can do with it and publish.ta

## Task 2
Provide SDOH index data that Ji Li has created and documented already. The SDOH is available via google big query APIs

* make available to AA. (how?)

* Need to discuss details of this, how to access, need documentation the SDOH data and of the APIs with examples.

* Need Jupyter notebook examples in python and R eventually.

## Task 3
Genomics daa
