## About the AIM-AHEAD Data Bridge project
To advance the science of reducing racial disparities and ensuring that AI/ML solutions in healthcare are designed to promote health equity, a multidisciplinary, collaborative consortium, AIM-AHEAD Data Bridge (AADB) has been formed to advance the access and use of diverse data by researchers and communities currently underrepresented in the development of AI/ML models and Predictive Analytics, and to enhance the capabilities of this emerging technology, beginning with rich and diverse sources of Electronic Health Records (EHR) data to address health disparities and inequities.

## Goal 1 - Setting up the Georgetown-SDOH datawarehouse

### Background and goals
The Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) highlights environmental and non-medical factors, such as economic and social conditions, that influence the health status of an individual or a group; to help measure the health disparities across the nation, and better understand the factors affect health outcomes and risks. Social Determinants of Health data can be found mostly in Census Bureau databases and other public databases (Add citation)

As part of the AIM AHEAD Data bridge initiative, the Georgetown-ICBI Team has downloaded, formatted and stored many of these datasets in the Googleâ€™s cloud database system BigQuery database format called the **_Georgetown-SDOH datawarehouse_**

### Summary of datasets used for SDOH
Here is a summary of the datasets used for SDOH : **[Georgetown-SDOH.md](https://github.com/ICBI/Data.Bridge.Notebooks/blob/main/Goal1_SDOH/README_About_GU_SDOH.md)**

#### SDOH Python Tutorials 
* Tutorial 1: How to extract information from the Georgetown-SDOH Bigquery datawarehouse using python scripts https://github.com/ICBI/Data.Bridge.Notebooks/blob/main/Goal1_SDOH/Tutorial1_BigQueryPythonGuide.ipynb

### SDOH Workshops
The Georgetown-ICBI Team will offer hands-on workshops to help users understand how to query SDOH data and make inferences using Tableau. More information about the workshops will be provided via the AIM AHEAD Connect platform: https://courses.aim-ahead.net/course/c/SDOH

## Goal 2 - Synthetic datasets
Georgetown-ICBI Provide synthetic versions of some data sets such as
